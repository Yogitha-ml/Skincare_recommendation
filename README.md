# Skincare_recommendation
This project aims to develop an intelligent skincare recommendation system that helps users find the most suitable skincare products and routines based on their unique skin type, concerns, and goals.

**Problem statement:**

Goal: Given a user’s skin type (oily/dry/combination/normal), concerns (acne, sensitivity, dark spots, aging), allergies, and budget, rank Sephora products and return top N with reasons (“no fragrance,” “low comedogenic score,” “contains niacinamide + ceramides”).
